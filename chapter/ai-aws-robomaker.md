## Introduction

Human's invented (and still inventing) many things to make human life easier. 
Some of the greatest inventions like  **wheels, airplanes, telephone** 
completely changed the way we travel and communicate. Computers and the 
Internet belong to this elite category which has disrupted the way we interact, 
gossip, read, learn, entertain and even think. 
 
We also are passionate to make machines more human. Due to lack of advanced 
technology this passion could not be realized till now. But now it is possible 
using  **AI**, **ML** and **cloud computing**. 
AWS RoboMaker is one such service from Amazon.

### Software vs Robot Applications
 
Unlike software development, robot applications development and testing are more 
complex as they involves hardware parts. Software can be easily tested on
computers, but testing robot applications by deploying to robots is not always 
feasible because the cost of hardware and building a robot will be high. 
A sophisticated simulation is required to create 3D model and test the robot 
application before they can be deployed on to the robot for final testing in the 
real world. 

## AWS RoboMaker

AWS RoboMaker [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm] service was introduced by Amazon in 
late 2018 to make robot application development and testing easier and 
cost-effective. This service provides a development environment to build 
robot applications, simulation to test the applications and deployment manager 
to deploy these applications on either a single robot or to a fleet of robots.

### AWS RoboMaker Features

AWS RoboMaker provides the following features [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-ft]

* [Cloud extension for ROS](#Cloud-Extension-for-ROS)
* [Development environment](#Development-environment)
* [Simulation](#Simulation)
* [Fleet management](#Fleet-Management)

#### Cloud Extension for ROS

ROS (Robot Operating System) was created at Stanford in 2007 as open source 
project. ROS provides software libraries to build robot applications and 
is widely used as default operating system in most of the modern-day robots. 
AWS RoboMaker provides the cloud extension for ROS to make it easier to integrate 
with other AWS services to delegate resource intensive tasks and freeing up 
robots to focus on main tasks. 

Out of box services that are supported with this ROS extension are

* Computer vision with Amazon Kinesis [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-kinesis] and 
Amazon Rekognition [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-rekognition]
* Voice command with Amazon Lex and Amazon Polly [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-polly]
* Monitoring and logging with Amazon CloudWatch [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-cloudwatch]

#### Development Environment  

One way to develop robot application is to setup a machine with all the 
required software. This will require to invest in high end machines as well 
as periodically keep maintaining the installed software.  

AWS RoboMaker provides a development environment to build and edit robot 
application online. No software to installation or maintenance required. 
RoboMaker development environment provides a fully-featured editor and 
pre-configured ROS tools with AWS Cloud9. Many sample application are available 
for reference and to quick start the development. 

#### Simulation

Testing the robot application in real-world with a complex and constantly 
changing environment will require a lot of investment in setting up such an 
environment as well as building the physical robot itself. AWS RoboMaker provides 
a full-featured simulation service using Gazebo to design 3D artificial models 
and movement of the robot within these simulated models. This service also 
provides many out-of-box 3D artificial models to get started right away. 

#### Fleet Management

After developing the robot application and testing, applications will be 
required to be deployed to the physical robot. AWS RoboMaker Fleet management 
service can register your robots. Once registered applications can be deployed 
to the robots over the air using AWS IoT Greengrass [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-greengrass] 
for both x86 and ARM based architectures.

## Getting Started

To get started, an AWS account is required [@sp20-516-223-aws-account]. AWS 
account provides access to all AWS services including RoboMaker. In the chapter, 
we will demonstrate how to run a sample Hello World application using AWS RoboMaker.

:o2: RoboMaker sample simulation run for default 1 hour, so terminate the job 
once done to avoid charges or free-tier allowance usage.

### Hello World

To illustrate RoboMaker features, we will launch an out-of-box Hello World 
sample application [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-sample]. 

1. Login in to your AWS account.
2. From Services menu, search RoboMaker and select the AWS RoboMaker from suggestions.
3. From RoboMaker service page, click on "Try Sample Application" link. 
4. Under Sample Application Details, select the radio button for the application 
of your choice. In this chapter we will select Hello World. 
5. Expand the Default Settings section and adjust the setting according to your 
use case. For this demonstration we will leave the defaults.
6. Carefully review the licensing information [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-gs-info].
7. Click on "Launch simulation job" to launch the simulation. 
8. AWS will provision and integrate with required services in order to run the 
sample simulation. You can monitor and manage using 
[AWS RoboMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker). After the 
sample application is created, you will be redirected to simulation job detail page. 
9. After the status of the simulation is changed to running, to launch and view the simulation, click on select
 Gazebo. This will launch the Gazebo client (gzclient) with the robot spinning clockwise in simulation environment.    

### Code Repository

#### Hello World github location

The Hello World sample application code is available on 
[github] (https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-sample-application-helloworld).

## Pricing

Pricing of AWS RoboMaker depends majorly on the number of features used and 
other AWS services that are integrated with the robot application. As many 
services can be integrated, the pricing is bit complicated. 

* [Cloud extension for ROS](#Cloud-Extension-for-ROS) are free under the
Apache Software License 2.0 and is a permissible licence with limited reuse 
restriction. However, you will incur standard AWS charges when the robot 
application uses other AWS services (like Polly, Lex, Rekognition etc.) through 
the cloud extension.

* [Development environment](#Development-environment) uses AWS Cloud 9 and 
charged at Standard AWS Cloud9 rates [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-c9-price]. Cloud9 has 
no additional charges but only charges for compute and storage resources used to 
run and store the code respectively. 

* [Simulation](#Simulation) will be charged only when the simulation is used. 
Amazon charges per SU (Simulation Unit). One SU is 1 CPU and 2 GB of memory and 
charges $0.40/SU/Hour. Depending upon the number of SUs used for your simulation, 
the cost will be computed. In addition to SU, EC2 standard rates also will be 
added to the cost based on the network traffic generated by the simulation.

* [Fleet management](#Fleet-Management) uses Greengrass to deploy robot 
application OTA (over-the-air) and thus charges standard AWS Greengrass 
pricing [@sp20-516-223-aws-rm-gg-price]. In general AWS Greengrass costs 
$0.16/Device/Month.

### Pricing Computation

We will demonstrate price computation of 2 Robots usage for 1 hour per day with 
no additional services.

### Cloud Extension Cost 

**Cloud Extension** will incur 0 cost as no additional services are used. 

### Development Environment Cost

Lets consider one person is developing the robot application and uses 
m4.large (8 GB) EC2 instance and 2 GB of storage completing the robot-application 
in 4 days. The cost can be computed as

Instance hours used: 8 hours/day * 4 days   = 32 hours

EC2 price/hour for m4.large                 = $0.10 

EC2 Total Charge                            = 32 * $0.10 = $3.2

EBS volume used: 2 GB                       = 2 * 1 = 2 **EBS is computed/month

Total EBS charges: 2 GB-month * $0.10/GB-month = $0.20

**Total Cost of Cloud9 Dev Environment**    = $3.2 + $0.2 = **$3.4**

### Simulation Cost

Lets consider that the developer uses 100 simulation hours with 2 SU. 
The cost can be computed as

Total SU-hours used: 100 hours * 2 SUs      = 200 SU-hours

RoboMaker simulation price per SU per hour  = $0.40

Total Simulation charges: 200 * $0.40       = $50

### Fleet Management Cost

Lets consider that we use 2 active Robots to manage. The cost can be computed as 

AWS Greengrass price per active device per month: $0.16

Total charges: 2 devices * $0.16/device = $0.32 

### Total Cost

**Total Overall Cost** for developing/testing/deploying and managing 
robot-application based on above assumptions will be

Total Cost = $3.4 + $50 + $0.32 = **$53.72**
